# Conways-Game-of-Life-Python
#
# To practice Python. I'll write the game/simulation, which was Invented by John Horton Conway in 1970.
# I basically followed a tutorial at https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-write-conwells-game-of-life-in-python-c6eca19c4676. Check it out, it is very well explained and a good way to do it

If you are python beginner as well. You will see that defining variables are simple. Functions, constructors and etc, are very similar to
other languages too. However formatting and possition is very enssential for your code to work. it can be easily noticed at "for" loops, where everything
that starts in a different line, need to have a space to be inside the loop.
also, I tried to modified at some points, and there's no switch funcion.
